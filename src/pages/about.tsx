                Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, known by its acronym
                KIIT, is one of the leading universities in India renowned for
                the quality of teaching and research. It was founded in 1992-93
                in a rented house with 12 students and 2 teachers as an
                Industrial Training Institute in Bhubaneswar. It was in this
                period when India was moving slowly towards globalisation, and
                private education was unpopular. However, Prof. Achyuta Samanta
                envisioned an educational institution that would focus on
                academic expertise and provide a wealth of opportunities for
                students to gain holistic knowledge - all this with barely any
                financial backing. It is solely due to the dedication, devotion
                and grit of our Founder and contribution from the hardworking
                staff and well-wishers, that KIIT Deemed to be University has
                become one of the premier educational hubs in India.With its
                base year in 1997 with just three programmes - Engineering, MBA
                & MCA, KIIT&apos;s commitment to excellence led to the grant of
                Deemed to be University status under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956
                by the Ministry of HRD, Govt. of India in 2004. KIIT has the
                distinction of being the youngest institute of the country to
                get a University status in six years. This unique achievement
                gave it a place in the Limca book of Records. It is indeed
                incredible to state that in a short span of time, KIIT has
                achieved incredible feats in ranking amongst the top colleges in
                this country. It has been ranked No. 1 among self-financing
                institutions of the country in the Atal Ranking of Institutions
                on Innovation Achievements (ARIIA), 2021 of the Ministry of
                Education, Government of India. It is India&apos;s 1st QS 5
                Stars Rated University (QS World University Ranking) and is the
                only University of India to hold the Prestigious ISAS badge
                (International Associations of University). It is also the only
                University of India to win the The Awards Asia for Leadership
                and Management by Times Higher Education Rankings for its
                unstinting commitment to its staff and students. Recently, KIIT
                ranked 8th globally for Reducing Inequalities by the Times
                Higher Education Impact Rankings 2022.Recently, it has been

                and has industry collaboration with more than 195 organisations

                source their talents form KIIT. For its outstanding contribution
                in the field of sports and games, KIIT has been awarded as the
                best Sports University of India (Sportstar Aces Award). The
                University has an unparalleled history of hosting Several
                International and National Seminars, Congresses, Workshops and

                India, KIIT provides a holistic human development model that
                cannot be experienced anywhere else in the country. The outreach
                work of KIIT University is on a massive scale in terms of social
                and economic empowerment. The contribution to sports in terms of
                producing sportspersons and creation of sports infrastructure is
                next to none. The students&apos; performance and belongingness
                within the campus, and in their workplace after they have
                graduated have inspired us to strive towards a higher degree of
                excellence. Instead of basking on its past glory and exponential
                growth, KIIT looks forward to achieving greater heights in world
                rankings, research and academics.

                approach -Educate, Enable, Empower while ensuring that the model
                prioritises indigenous control of education, to preserve the
                culture, heritage and traditions of India&apos;s diverse tribal
                communities and fulfil the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 in
                its entirety.
